Question: Take three variables as input and ad them without using the operator '+'
Start
Sum=0
n=3
Enter three variables a,b,c
Read a,b,c
Ratio=r
If (a/b==b/c)&& ( r>1) then
   Print "sum=(a(r^n-1))/(r-1)"
Else,if (a/b==b/c)&&(r<1)then
   Print"sum=(a(1-r^n))/(1-r)"
Else,if (a/b!=b/c)||(r==1) then
   multiply a,b,c by -1
   a,b,c = -a,-b,-c
   Print "sum=-(-a)-(-b)-(-c)"
