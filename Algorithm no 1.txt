Question: Write an algorithm for determining if Nth number is divisor of n number.If so,determine if its an even number or odd number as well.
Start
Input a number=Nth
Input a number=n
Read Nth, n
Set quotient=n/Nth
If (quotient=real number)
   Divide quotient by 2
   End-if(remainder==0) then
    Print"Nth is divisor of n,
             quotient is even"
    Else 
          Print"Nth is divisor of n,
           quotient is odd"
Else
   Print"Nth is not the divisor of n"
